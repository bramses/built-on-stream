# Draft

Picture this: you are a [[cannonball that has just been fired out a cannon]]. You feel yourself picking up velocity towards your unfortunate target. As you reach the maximum point in your arc, you pause to reflect. You think to yourself: "What is the purpose of all of this?" "What will happen after I land?" "Will I ever fly again?" 

You unfortunately do not get much time to consider these impossibilities before you crash into the ground, twenty feet away from your target.

Now instead, [[imagine yourself as a boomerang]]. As you hurl towards your target you harbor similar sentiments to the cannonball, but you breathe easy knowing that even if you miss, you will have another chance to get better from the hands of your thrower.

Posting content on the internet is a very similar experience to being shot out of a cannon. A creator will pour their effort and soul into some form of creative output: be it video, writing, code, etc.. They'll convert potential energy and [[lock ideas into scripts and sketches]], make decisions that are nigh irreversible. Then they will post it on [[some IP address]]. This might be an IP address they bought from a domain provider, or someone else's (most likely a company's) IP address. They will then hope that someone sees the work they've created. They'll hope and hope that their idea will take a life of its own, and go on to influence other ideas or make the world a better place in any meager sort of way.

## The Repositories

Let's say you had a phenomenal idea. You know this idea has merit and it has affected your life deeply. You have decided that this is an idea worth sharing, and that you would like to [[help your species evolve within one lifetime]]. You rush to the nearest node of the Internet and type up/upload data of your idea. You then are faced with a choice. Do you:
1. post it on your own website
2. post it on the main social media of the day's site
3. post it on both
4. not post it at all

There are pros and cons to any and all of these choices. Let's take a look at them.

### Option 1: You Post it on your own Website

Congratulations! You've gone with option #1. You put up your golden idea at a sub URL within your domain. You go on with life, not knowing if anyone will happen across it, until two months later, you find that someone has cross posted it to a social media aggregation site (*think reddit or hn*). You are awestruck by the rapid increase in traffic and silently fist pump, knowing that your idea finally has achieved spread that you believe it deserves. However, when you return the next day, you see that your impressions have gone back nearly to zero.

You can't blame anyone for this fact. Indeed, the internet is a tapestry of URLs that no one would really ever bother to remember anyway. Your idea is stripped away from you, not because it left your domain, but because no one remembers where to find it.

Your effort has been dropped into a shallow hole where you are the only person who can speak, but no one is there to listen.

### Option 2: You Post it on the Social Media of the Day

Congratulations! You've gone with option #2. You put up your golden idea on a sub URL in someone else's domain. You go on with life, not knowing if anyone will happen across it, until two minutes later, when your notifications on your phone go f\*ckin ballistic and you are now the focus of 1 million strangers on the Internet. You are awestruck by the rapid increase in your follower count and silently fist pump, knowing that your idea has finally achieved the spread you believe it deserves. However, you return the next day, not to see a bunch of helpful insightful comments, but instead, a collection of mean spirited words tossed at your person. In addition to this, enough people liked your idea, that they just steal it for their own social gain. And in addition to that, the social media website you posted it on has decided to just go ahead and monetize your idea for themselves. They  send you a check making you feel good, but also kinda bad? Your idea is stripped away from you, from internet strangers -- some who mean well, others who very much don't, and most who are ambivalent.

Your effort has been dropped into a deep, deep hole, where there are millions of other ideas (some signal, others noise) occupying the same shared space. Your idea never surfaces again. That is, unless, it can make the platform some moola.

### Option 3: You post it on both

Congratulations! You have decided to post your golden idea on both your website and social media. On the surface of it, this seems like a really good idea. It seems to address the downsides of both. Your idea is immediately visible, but also long lasting since it is posted to your own domain. You remain hopeful that people will find some way to engage with you on your own platform, but you are happy that you have multiple arms to your business.

You then realize, quite abruptly, that there are only 24 hours in a day. You **could** post to your own website, but you've been getting so much more immediate feedback from social media X, so why bother continually posting on your own site? In the long run, you gravitate towards social media and your site gets neglected. But hey, at least you tried!

You are given the forced choice to split your effort until burn out sounds like a pretyyy good option. You try to fill an infinitely deep hole, and a very shallow hole with one bucket of water. How do you think your water will be spent?

### Option 4: You don't post it

Exhausted by the previous options, you decide to just say "to hell with it" and not post your idea anywhere. You scrap bin it, and get on with your life. This may **feel** like the best option, but allow me to make the case as to why it's the worst of the bunch.

**Posting on the internet is a non linear activity.**

This terminology gets thrown around a lot but deserves a little bit of elaboration. When an activity is **linear**, I'm of the mind to think that the cause and effect are linked. Examples:
- you put chicken in the oven -> it gets hot -> it gets burnt
- a barber puts clippers on someone's hair -> it gets cut -> they have a stylish new 'do
- the movie theater licenses a movie -> people pay for a movie ticket -> people watch the movie 

When it comes to creating content on the internet, the cause and effect is **not linked**. There is no reliable metric to know if your work will receive 1 impression or 1 million impressions. And in fact, since your work does not degrade with time, and is impacted very little by entropy, this work could be **more** valuable in the time and space you are not currently in.  It could result in financial gain, gain in relationships (or cost to either of these as well).

This, of course means that the best strategy is to post. And to post **a lot**, at as **high of a quality** you can muster. This will give your ideas the best chance at making an impact and making you feel like an impactful human being (this one is quite causal!)

The brain is a well of ideas whether we desire for it to be or not. As an associative machine, the brain's cardinal goal is to make associations. These associations can go on to influence other brains through communication, or stay bouncing around in the skull of the creator. Set ideas free, and help the species grow as other ideas have helped you grow into the person you are.

## The Effort That Was Spent

In all of the situations above, a person has spent an amount of effort into a specified goal. This effort, this work, was most likely done in solitude, or at least, done in a place where the creator put in a lot of effort without validating the idea.

Is there any way to reclaim some of this effort? Is there any way to increase the size of our bucket and increase the proposition of posting to our domains while also being able to not have to worry as heavily about what happens if our final product falls flat?

For this, I'd like to talk about gamers.

### Gamers, Twitch, and Working in Public

[[Twitch.tv]] is a website that came out in 2007(?) under the original name justin.tv. One of the founders of Twitch, [[Justin Kan]], used his new website to film every moment of his life. This turned out to be quite the spectacle for many people around the globe, and have been the [[first ever day in my life]] video series. As Twitch evolved and began to cater towards a [[growing e-sports scene in the 2010s]] many people who in the past were just gamers evolved into gamers...but with money. In the modern era, Twitch has attracted many other types of streamers who have realized the value proposition of being able to stream something they were already doing for free. This includes: cooking, just chatting, software development, IRL, and much more. Basically, anything that could be done with a camera or on a computer was fair game. This opened up a brand new market of entertainment that was both unedited, unscripted, but also [[immensely valuable]]. 

### Byproducts and Twitch Streamers making YouTube Videos

The business model of a Twitch streamer is as following:

1. go live
2. say whatever is on your mind/do something you've prepared/do something unprepared
3. *after stream* review the vod and extract the highlights
4. upload those as individual highlights/clips/etc.
5. people find the vods either through direct searching or recommendation
6. people tune into the stream, making the next stream more engaging and impactful

Let's compare this to the other model of creating content on the internet:

1. have an idea
2. research if said idea is feasible with your particular set of skills and resources
3. create said idea
4. post said idea onto the internet
5. people find idea either through direct searching or recommendation

Do you notice the main difference between these two models? The first model has:

1. an extremely short feedback loop
2. extraction of value at each step
3. a creation of a loop, as opposed to a one way arrow


## An Extremely Short Feedback Loop

Working in tech, a cardinal rule (even more important than spaces vs tabs), is to understand the user needs. In fact, this is a tenet of good design in general. [[Good designs have affordances]] for their users, and meet the user where they are.

Twitch streamers have extremely tight feedback loops. Very similar to programming, they receive immediate feedback around the validity of an idea through a live audience.
Other content creators (bloggers, podcasters, video creators, etc.) have the benefit of being able to edit their work before anyone sees it, and maintain an air of secrecy, but must do multiples of the legwork in convincing people that what they've created is noteworthy. Nothing starts out as a final product, and transparency into building something helps garner both trust and surfaces some interesting undiscovered opportunities around an idea.

## Extraction of Value at Each Step

The advantage of the livestream to final output cycle is that value isn't sequestered in just the final work. The value comes from the byproducts of the entire process, **including the final piece**.

In a way, the streams find a way to become value in themselves, which may eclipse the final product you set out to create in the first place.

It's never been easier to record the work that you do and share it publicly, and as a competitive advantage, thinking in the way of creating a virtuous cycle is required to compete.  

[[Companies of one]] need all the help they can get. Companies of one don't have the luxury of being able to hire entire teams to take of different verticals within their business. In general, a company of one will be an expert at a very narrow skill set, so it behooves individual creators to take advantage of what technology offers and how to advance their career through doing what they enjoy!


## The Creation of a Loop, As Opposed to a One Way Arrow

Notice an immediate difference?

One is a loop! Loops are good for business! [[Create a flywheel]]!

## A Real Life Example

This post that you have just read, has been filmed in its entirety. From the conception of the idea, to the setup of the software, to the outline, to the drafting, to the editing, every part of this piece was created on a live stream.

This creation process has resulted in this piece and in addition has created X(*todo*) highlights.

If you're curious to see how this works you can check out the highlights here:

## Going Forward

I'm very, very fascinated by what this model can mean for content creators. By opening up the floor to the process of writing, coding, video editing, etc., there is a much more organic aspect to the creative lifecycle and I would argue, more well thought out output.

The cons of hosting video on the Internet have largely been ameliorated by sites like Twitch and YouTube. All it takes is a microphone a screen recording software, and a willingness to record the process that you were [[most likely already in the process of doing.]]
