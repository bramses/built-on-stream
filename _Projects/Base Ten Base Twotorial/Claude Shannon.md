- > ==he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship==
- introduced to work of Boole in college and four years later (1936) was working on Bush's Diff Analyzer
- switches -> logic is the fundamental concept of computing
- >  ==[Howard Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner "Howard Gardner") called Shannon's thesis "possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.==

> Before Shannon, the problem of communication was primarily viewed as a deterministic signal-reconstruction problem: how to transform a received signal, distorted by the physical medium, to reconstruct the original as accurately as possible. ==Shannon’s genius lay in his observation that the key to communication is uncertainty. ==After all, if you knew ahead of time what I would say to you in this column, what would be the point of writing it?

> Given that framework of uncertainty and probability, Shannon set out in his landmark paper to systematically determine the fundamental limit of communication. His answer came in three parts. ==Playing a central role in all three is the concept of an information “bit,” used by Shannon as the basic unit of uncertainty. A portmanteau of “binary digit,” a bit could be either a 1 or a 0==, and Shannon’s paper is the first to use the word (though he said the mathematician John Tukey used it in a memo first).


> Finally, he showed that reliable communication of the information from the source in the face of noise is possible if and only if _H_ < _C._ Thus, information is like water: If the flow rate is less than the capacity of the pipe, then the stream gets through reliably.


> His theorems led to some counterintuitive conclusions. Suppose you are talking in a very noisy place. What’s the best way of making sure your message gets through? Maybe repeating it many times? That’s certainly anyone’s first instinct in a loud restaurant, but it turns out that’s not very efficient. Sure, the more times you repeat yourself, the more reliable the communication is. But you’ve sacrificed speed for reliability. Shannon showed us we can do far better. ==Repeating a message is an example of using a code to transmit a message, and by using different and more sophisticated codes, one can communicate fast — all the way up to the speed limit, _C_ — while maintaining any given degree of reliability.==

> Another unexpected conclusion stemming from Shannon’s theory is that whatever the nature of the information — be it a Shakespeare sonnet, a recording of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony or a Kurosawa movie — ==it is always most efficient to encode it into bits before transmitting it.==
> So in a radio system, for example, even though both the initial sound and the electromagnetic signal sent over the air are analog wave forms, Shannon’s theorems imply that it is optimal to first digitize the sound wave into bits, and then map those bits into the electromagnetic wave. **This surprising result is a cornerstone of the modern digital information age, where the bit reigns supreme as the universal currency of information.**

> Shannon figured out the foundation for all this more than 70 years ago. How did he do it? By focusing relentlessly on the essential feature of a problem while ignoring all other aspects. The simplicity of his model of communication is a good illustration of this style. He also knew to focus on what is possible, rather than what is immediately practical.
