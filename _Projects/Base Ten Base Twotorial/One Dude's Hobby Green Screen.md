### Leibniz's Philosophy Hobby

Leibniz really loved eastern literature and was inspired by one book in particular suggested recommended by his friend Joachim Bouvet:
+ the I-Ching

### The I-Ching

<split even>

+ written by Fu Xi b/w 10th and 4th cent BC
+ Fu Xi observed patterns and created the *eight trigrams*
+ *Binary* poles of reality of Yin and Yang
+ reality is a dream from the binaries of yin and yang

+ Lebiniz restructured binary to convert verbal logic into math
+ at first, he had no use for binary
+ **until it fit his philosophy with the I-Ching and he doubled down**

### Claude Shannons (Super Important) College Paper

+ realized that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship
+ in other words, on off electrical switches could be **any number** or **any logical statement**
+ **fundamental concept of computing**

<!-- slide data-background-color="rgba(0, 177, 64, 1)" data-background-opacity="0" -->
### But He's Not Done

+ after changing the world of computing, he changed the world of information communication
+ represented a binary digit as a unit of **uncertainty**
+ and this allowed us to realize that every message can be turned into **a most efficient form through code**
+ and not just any code
	+ **BINARY**
+ error correcting (CDs, Voyager spacecraft -> data quality in the noise)

- Fu Xi wrote the **I Ching**, saying reality was entirely made up of fulgurations of Yin and Yang, and that all of reality is held within the 64 hexagrams
+ Thousands of years later, **Leibniz** read the I Ching after inventing calculus and converted binary from a religious, philosophical concept into a mathematical one
+ Hundreds of years later, **Boole** used binary to formulate a new branch of mathematics
+ A hundred years after that **Shannon** turned boolean logic into real life electrical signals and an extremely fast form of communicating
