# History of the Binary System^[[History of the Binary System](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/BinaryHistory.shtml)]

- binary representation is simple -- any number can be represented with only two digits -- 0 and 1
- underlies all of modern computing
	- computer states may only be off/on
- ENIAC
	- _Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator_
	- built in 1946 -- was the first to use binary
- Leibniz created binary in 1701 ^[this is untrue -- ENIAC actually used decimal https://cs.calvin.edu/activities/books/rit/chapter2/history/electronic.htm]
	- first published at the Paris Academy but he had invented it 20 years earlier
- the subscript two is used to avoid confusion with the more common base 10 model
- decimal system = powers of ten; binary = powers 0f 2
- ==binary is cumbersome to use in speech so often people translate it to decimal==
- ==the first element of hundred "hund"^[ == dekm-ton in Indo-European] means 10==
	- ==ye olde english hundred == tens-number, or more literally ten times ten==
	- ==thousand == olde english thus-hund -> a swollen hundred literally==
	- TODO: how did the Romans pronounce numbers?

> 1.  Use decimal symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 (in a cyclic order).
> 2. Decimal representations of numbers during their counting change with the right-most digit changing the fastest.
> 3. Whenever a digit becomes 0, its neighbor to the left is replaced with its successor in the sequence of decimal symbols. If necessary, this step applies recursively.
> 4. If need be, i.e. whenever the left-most digit becomes 0, 1 is prepended to the previous representation.

- numbers as a count to drum beats, naming was a great invention in 1000 years ^[[until the decimal system was introduced by Leonardo Fibonacci in 1202](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/frac_conv.shtml)] ^b10c4d
- [[History of the Binary System#^381a3c|binary uses the same algorithm but with one and zero]]
- all unique (counting) numbers have binary representations since they are translations of the same ruleset
- ==**all counting numbers can be explained in a power of 2**==
