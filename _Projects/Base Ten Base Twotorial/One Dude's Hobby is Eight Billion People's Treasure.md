+ co-invented calculus
+ trolled an entire alchemy society
</split>

<split even>

![[sad leib.png]]

+ bald, wore huge wigs
+ lifelong "bachelor"
+ few people came to his funeral
+ Voltaire gave him 1 star posthumously
</split>

### Leibniz's Philosophy Hobby

Leibniz really loved eastern literature and was inspired by one book in particular suggested recommended by his friend Joachim Bouvet:
+ the I-Ching

### The I-Ching

<split even>
![[Pasted image 20220819205122.png]]
+ written by Fu Xi b/w 10th and 4th cent BC
+ Fu Xi observed patterns and created the *eight trigrams*
+ *Binary* poles of reality of Yin and Yang
+ reality is a dream from the binaries of yin and yang
</split>

### Sixty Four Palms

Inspired the Hyuga clan in Naruto (*pair permutation trigrams*)

### Leibniz's Philosophy Hobby

after reading the I-Ching, Leibniz saw the hexagrams as affirmation of his universal beliefs

#### A Quick Primer on His Philosophical Belief

<split even>

+ Monadology
	+ written by Leibniz at age 70
+ world made of monads, a simple substance == indivisible
+ God is the perfect monad, uses *fulgurations* to create monads
</split>

### The (Re)Birth of Binary

<split even>
![[Pasted image 20220818213038.png]]
- Binary had been around since Egypt
+ Lebiniz restructured binary to convert verbal logic into math
+ at first, he had no use for binary
+ **until it fit his philosophy with the I-Ching and he doubled down**

### George Boole

### Boolin'

<split even>
![[Pasted image 20220825232553.png]]

- created formal boolean logic
</split>

### Inspired by Leibniz?

+ **Mary Everest Boole, e.g., wrote that her husband, having been informed of Leibniz’s anticipations of his own logic, felt “as if Leibnitz had come and shaken hands with him across the centuries”**

### Claude Shannon

![[Pasted image 20220825234517.png]]
1916-2001

---
### Claude Shannons (Super Important) College Paper
+  introduced to work of Boole in college and four years later (1936) was working on Bush's Diff Analyzer
+ realized hat electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship
+ in other words, on off electrical switches could be **any number** or **any logical statement**
+ **fundamental concept of computing**

---

### But He's Not Done

+ after changing the world of computing, he changed the world of information communication
+ represented a binary digit as a unit of **uncertainty**
+ and this allowed us to realize that every message can be turned into **a most efficient form through code**
+ and not just any code
	+ **BINARY**
+ error correcting (CDs, Voyager spacecraft -> data quality in the noise)

### The Lineage is Complete

# In Sum

---

- Fu Xi wrote the I Ching, saying reality was entirely made up of fulgurations of Yin and Yang, and that all of reality is held within the 64 hexagrams
+ Thousands of years later, Leibniz read the I Ching after inventing calculus and converted binary from a religious, philosophical concept into a mathematical one
+ Hundreds of years later, Boole used binary to formulate a new branch of mathematics
+ A hundred years after that Shannon turned boolean logic into real life electrical signals and an extremely fast form of communicating

# And a hundred years after these giants?...
