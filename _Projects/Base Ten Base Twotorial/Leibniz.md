- polymath
- ==he was a live streamer==
- ==Monadology - a book written at 70 about his philosophical system==
	- monad ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology] is a simple substance, and the Pythagoreans saw it as the supreme being
		-  ==TODO: learn more about the Pythagoreans=
			- weren't greeks a polytheistic culture? so how could a monad be a single supreme being?
			- > According to [Diogenes Laërtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius "Diogenes Laërtius"), from the monad evolved the [dyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(Greek_philosophy) "Dyad (Greek philosophy)"); from it numbers; from numbers, points; then lines, two-dimensional entities, three-dimensional entities, bodies, culminating in [the four elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") earth, water, fire and air, from which the rest of our world is built up
	- *fulgurations* - a flash of lightning 
		- Creation is a permanent state thus monads are generated by lightning flashes of the creator
	- > ==When Leibniz says that monads are 'simple,' he means that "which is one, has no parts and is therefore indivisible"==
	- if a monad subsumes another monad, it is said to "dominate" when it contains the actions of another monad
	- > ==Leibniz argues that it would be impossible to conceive of a more perfect world because all things in the world are created by and imitating the best possible monad==

- wrote over 10k letters he was a very popular Andy talked with over 1100 people
- “One who knows me only by published works does not know me at all”.^[based quote]
- Voltaire posthumously attacked Leibniz for his optimistic determinism, greatly damaging his reputation 50 years after his death
- Germany gives out large grants in Leibniz' name -- making Germany a leader in science

		- Leonardo did extensive preparatory work for it but produced only a large clay model, which was later destroyed. About five centuries later, Leonardo's surviving designs were used as the basis for sculptures intended to bring the project to fruition.

- binary numbers date back to ancient egypt (remember the coils)
	- return the slab
	- ![[Pasted image 20220818213038.png]]
- he created binary as a way to convert verbal logic statements into mathematical statements
	- initially had little purpose to Leibniz outside of his own philosophy
- ==in WWII, early computer creators used binary to restrict the language of the switches to on and off== (ENIAC)
	- binary picked up popularity but wasn't a done deal initially

[Binary code - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code#History_of_binary_codes)
- > Leibniz's system uses 0 and 1, like the modern binary numeral system. Leibniz encountered the _[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching "I Ching")_ through French Jesuit [Joachim Bouvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Bouvet "Joachim Bouvet") and noted with fascination how its [hexagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_(I_Ching) "Hexagram (I Ching)") correspond to the binary numbers from 0 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical visual binary [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") he admired.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code#cite_note-smith-3) ==Leibniz saw the hexagrams as an affirmation of the universality of his own religious belief.==



# I Ching

- Fu Xi was the legendary first author of the I-Ching
-  According to the canonical _Great Commentary_, Fu Xi observed the patterns of the world and created the [eight trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua "Bagua") (八卦; _bāguà_), "in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things
- ==Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form== (footnote)
- > The I-Ching represents the binary poles of reality as Yin and Yang. Like 1 and 0, these are abstract concepts that can represent the poles of any binary set, but in the text of the I-Ching are often discussed as female and male. They are notated with a broken line for Yin, and an unbroken line for Yang. These lines are combined in sets of three to produce the eight basic trigrams, which are in turn combined to give the 64 hexagrams, which are at the heart of the I-Ching's system of [divination](http://divination.com/resources/articles/history/).
- ==Neji in Naruto ^[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sixty-Four_Palms] uses trigrams which are a pair permutation of hexagrams==
	- > The ancient Chinese classic, [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching "I Ching") ([Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): Yi Jing), consists of the 64 pairwise permutations of trigrams, referred to as "[hexagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_(I_Ching) "Hexagram (I Ching)")", along with commentary on each one. ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua]
- > The I-Ching was far more ambitious than the current practical applications of binary code, even in the most powerful supercomputer. The 64 hexagrams of the I-Ching claim to represent nothing less than the archetypal situations of human life itself. To "read" the I-Ching, a person uses either coin tosses or [yarrow stalks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination) to generate a hexagram. Each hexagram is accompanied by an explanatory text
- > ==In the philosophy of the I-Ching, reality is not entirely real. It is something more like a dream or an illusion. This dream of reality arises from the binaries of Yin and Yang, as they play out their infinite combinations.==
