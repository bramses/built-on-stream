- ==The Eniac was made to calcuate ballistic tables in WWII==

- first electronic computer to run without any electronic parts
- for a decade it ran computing until it was struck by lightning, but may have record for most computations done ever

[Computer Memory: Past and Future](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~meesh/cmsc411/website/projects/ramguide/pastandfuture/pastandfuture.html)
- no central memory -- 20 accumulators - one could hold a 10 digit number
- had a ring of flip flops that triggered each other
- the core memory (1952) remained the fastest memory created until the 80s
	- held onto information using ferrite magnets
- ==TODO: Holographic Memory==
- > In celebration of ENIACâ€™s 50th Anniversary, the machine was reimplemented using modern integrated circuit technology. The room-sized computer could now fit in the palm of your hand

- total cost was $487k or $6m in todays money
- UPenn led by Herman Goldstine
- > ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.

- came before ENIAC (1938)
- first ==programmable computer with boolean logic==
