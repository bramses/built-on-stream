[Leibniz’s Influence on 19th Century Logic (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-logic-influence/)
- some scholars believe Leibniz was critical to renaissance in early 20th century others think his work got lost and didn't influence Boole
- > It seems to be in accord with the second position that the pioneers of modern logic themselves referred to Leibniz. George Boole’s widow, ==**Mary Everest Boole, e.g., wrote that her husband, having been informed of Leibniz’s anticipations of his own logic, felt “as if Leibnitz had come and shaken hands with him across the centuries”**==
