## Slack

- Slack is the natural enemy of efficiency, and efficiency is the natural enemy of slack. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=120))
- It is the middle of the organization where reinvention takes place. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=153))
- Slack is the time when you are 0 percent busy. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=163))
- The waste associated with time-sharing between two tasks is the sum of time lost to the mechanics of the switch plus rework required upon restart plus immersion time plus frustration cost. ==**You pay the penalty each time you switch.**== ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=290))
- ==Fragmented knowledge workers== may look busy, but a lot of their busyness is just thrashing, switching continually from one activity to another. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=328))
- in modern knowledge work, nothing is ever static. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=359))
- Control, as they see it, is their payment for working. Deny the control or assume it yourself and they’re gone. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=399))
    - Note: (Knowledge workers)
- Communication in healthy companies takes place in the white space. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=422))
- Oliver arrives the day after **Orin** departs. I think you will agree that Oliver is essentially useless on his first day, since most of what he’s doing is getting his bearings (this, too, is part of the acquisition of ==domain knowledge==). He’s even worse than useless, as he is using up other people’s time to get him jumpstarted. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=510))
- the ==stars== had long before taken whatever steps were necessary to establish good connections. They had spread around favors, been responsive themselves, nursed relationships, seen to other people’s essential human needs. The “stars” had richer connections than their peers … To establish a standardized way of doing any knowledge task, you end up focusing on the mechanics of the task. But the mechanics are a small and typically not very important portion of the whole. How the work goes on inside the nodes of the worker diagram is not nearly so important as ==how wide and rich are the connections.== ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=1427))
- ==When the new automation is in place, there is less total work to be done by the human worker, but what work is left is harder. That is the paradox of automation: It makes the work **harder, not easier**. After all, it was the easy stuff that got absorbed into the machine, so what’s left is, almost by definition, fuzzier, less mechanical, and more complex.== ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVC2Y&location=1435))
- You can’t empower anyone without taking chances. The power you’ve granted is the power to err.==If that person messes up, you take the consequences.== Looked at from the opposite perspective, it is this capacity to injure the person above you that makes empowerment work.
