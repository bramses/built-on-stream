# Insights

1. Introduction to Milluki
2. The manual art of removing a url from the list
3. Converting to MD
4. What happens when its in the vault?


We are what we consume. ==Our history tells us a story of the information we have and how we came to it.==

Chrome stores all the pages you visit and those pages are sometimes linked to each other or reached for directly. This is a passive process.

Milluki is a Chrome Extension that fetches all links visited in a day. The user then edits the list, removing URLs they don't want in the final list. Finally, a Markdown table is generated of links and titles. This markdown table is copied to the clipboard and the user places it into their Obsidian vault.
