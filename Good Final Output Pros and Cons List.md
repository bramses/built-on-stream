# Pros
## Video

^141361
- most passive consumption vehicle listed
	- it is delivered on an audio+video silver platter
- most data (visual, auditory, text (_optional_) of all of the final types
- conveys the most personality (can also be a con lol, if you don't like a person's personality, or the development of [parasocial relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzyQbfh4t_8))
- there is a lot of repetition in the space -- so new ideas stand out
- pays the most at least as a B2C model and with sponsorships
- helping you work on public speaking skillset as well
- [people are okay with ads these days vs in 2007 when they said you were a sellout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wPhbdUAwyU)
- pre compiled

## Traditional Blog

^c54ff5
- it is super lightweight -- using [SSR type platforms](https://nextjs.org/) you can deliver a ton of information over KBs of transmission
- really easy SEO
- way easier to make high quality content
	- only real skill that matters EoD is clear writing
- a skill that only increases as you continue to do it
- a skill that can be worked on your whole life

## ScrollyTelling

^b78644
- Like blogging but with [image transitions](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)

^24e536
- one of the easiest to create, because its akin to a collage

# Cons
## Video

^0ba39e
- most data (visual, auditory, text (_optional_) of all of the final types
	- does not work well if you are on a network that is throttled -- or cant deliver a ton of data
- videos require takes (and takes are super repetitive)
- requires the most editing (which i do not know how to do as of [[2022-08-02]])
- ton of competition in all verticals from 15sec (TikTok) all the way up to feature length movies
- little customizability in the way of code and interactivity (offset by streaming, for example, [DougDoug - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClyGlKOhDUooPJFy4v_mqPg))
- have to play on big platforms to make it worth it -- and the baggage that comes with that (_regular social media baggage + fear of being kicked off + algorithm destroying you + [self worth distilled into a number on a screen_](https://youtu.be/c3xSJuoUnN8))
	- yt + tt + twitch all run off of recommendation algorithms
	- a spider like Google or DDG or Bing will not bother to transcribe your video, giving it an SEO of effectively zero
## Traditional Blog

^4e1968
- less personality -- unless its a book
- name recognition is pretty difficult due to lack of facial recognition
- less readers out there compared to watchers
- pays very little to zero unless you are willing to clog your site with ads
	- substack has done a good job of converting readers
- feel guilty? like the effort from obsidian streams is wasted?
- no big distribution website that is neither twitter or medium (?)
- less people bother to read

- [can fail across multiple devices - weird css bugs and gpu errors](https://twitter.com/anmpog/status/1188870242891517955?s=20&t=GjHazhzTlzaofIc94KCSHA)
# Graph Blogging

^e7f675
- scales very poorly
- requires the most active work from the end user
- most likely would stay niche for pretty much ever
- content these days is consumed mainly through mobile or highly optimized cdn sites like [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/)
