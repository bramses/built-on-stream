## Dream Machine
the essence of **Baran’s** network—packets, a decentralized architecture, computer routing—was the same as his. So why hadn’t Baran’s plan been adopted already? ==Because it was too **far ahead of its time**, apparently==. **AT&T engineers**, most of whom had spent a lifetime perfecting their circuit-switching network, found Baran’s packet-switching concept ludicrous (“Son,” Baran remembers one telling him with exaggerated patience, “this is how a telephone works ...”).

- Roberts was backed by ARPA, whose whole reason for existing was to cut through the bureaucracy. ([Location 7038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=7038))
- “We found ourselves imagining all kinds of possibilities,” Crocker says. “Interactive graphics, cooperating processes, automatic database query, electronic mail.” ([Location 7263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=7263))
- It was a blast, he remembers, and they let their imaginations run riot. What did it matter, after all? They were just grad students; professionals from the East would come around to tell them about the real protocols soon enough. So they started fantasizing about things like mobile interfaces, little chunks of software that would migrate through the net and allow you to interact with an application on a remote machine as if it were right in front of you ([Location 7270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=7270))
    - Note: Same with ai imagining?
- ==To Lick, as Anderson soon realized, the important thing was to **have fun** with computers, to keep on pushing toward the future.== ([Location 10512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=10512))
- And I’d never liked the information-utility notion, which I first heard from Fano. Information isn’t natural gas. It doesn’t come from one place, or a few places. It comes from all over. ([Location 10623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=10623))
- Being Greek, I thought of the Athens flea market, where I used to spend every Sunday, and I envisioned an on-line version: a community with very large numbers of people coming together in a place where they could buy, sell, and exchange information.

- suppose we had just invented the car, and I was asking them to study the ==social implications== when they were still focused on the engine and trying to make it go from ==twenty miles per hour to thirty miles per hour==.

- The climactic moment came when Jobs pointed out that Smalltalk scrolled through text one full line at a time, which made its action rather jerky; **he wondered aloud if it couldn’t scroll continuously**, one bit-mapped pixel at a time. Sure, said Dan Ingalls, Smalltalk’s lead programmer. He opened a window, changed a few lines of the scrolling code, then closed the window again, and voilà! Through the modular magic of object-oriented programming, Smalltalk now scrolled continuously. ([Location 11305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11305))
- “Lisa must be fun to use,” ([Location 11318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11318))
- TCP/IP on January 1, 1983—an event that many would call the actual birth of the Internet. ([Location 11655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11655))
- networking was just as balkanized as, half a decade earlier, Lick had feared it would be, with many researchers still lacking network access of any kind. ([Location 11685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11685))
- in 1986 Gore wrote legislation asking the administration to study the possibility of networking the supercomputer centers with fiber optics. ([Location 11762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11762))
- the Internet as the VAX strategy writ large: a “fractal” network of networks that would be self-similar from the scale of the planet down to the scale of a microchip. ([Location 11766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11766))
- the Gore bill ran into flak from the White House, where Republican budget officials argued that such initiatives ought to be left to the private sector. The high-performance-computing half of the proposal wouldn’t be passed and signed into law until December 1991. And the networking half wouldn’t be added until early 1993, when a newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton would sign a second Gore bill turning the effort into the High Performance Computing and Communication program, or HPCC. ([Location 11783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11783))
- we started doing things like sharing the cost of overseas lines, or putting in exchanges to interconnect our networks.” ([Location 11796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11796))

- ==Government runs by fad and fashion==. ([Location 11811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11811))
- “The creation of those regional nets and the requirement that they become self-funding was the key to the evolution of the current Internet.” ([Location 11835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11835))
- every host computer on the Internet needed a name, and everybody wanted to claim “Frodo.”) ([Location 11871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11871))
- “Take all that stuff off!” she demanded. She tried somehow to make them understand that this was a man who lived by his brains, whose greatest joy was the playful workings of his imagination ([Location 11928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11928))
- ==Technology isn’t destiny, no matter how inexorable its evolution may seem==; the way its capabilities are used is as much a matter of cultural choice and historical accident as politics is, or fashion. ([Location 11979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11979))
- ==without an ARPA animated by J. C. R. Licklider’s vision—there would have been no ARPA community, no Arpanet, no TCP/IP, and no Internet==. ([Location 11990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=11990))
