**Takeaway**: 

1. Stated preferences vs Revealed preferences.
2. Why people lie to protect relationships. 
3. Real life example on my own app Stenography.
4. What revealed preferences mean for creators and what they mean for consumers. 

# Revealed Preferences

> Revealed preference models assume that the preferences of consumers can be revealed by their purchasing habits.


> Let there be two bundles of goods, a and b, available in a budget set $$B$$. If it is observed that a is chosen over b, then a is considered (directly) revealed preferred to b.

On Stenography -- the **data being different than the conversations**; friends and family aren't the best resource due to them wanting to protect you

> Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. **We crave validation** and, as such, are often tricked into registering compliments as reliable data instead of vacuous fibs. Sometimes it’s easier to spot the symptoms than to notice the sneaky compliment itself. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=329))

## Producing
Make apps impossibly easy to interface with. Make apps where the system runs itself. **Simplify and feature cull (v1)**,  **put hard stuff in the backend where users don't notice it (v2)**. Don't trust words, or narrative data! 

## Consuming
**Boredom is a great tool to find your revealed preferences.** 

When you are overloaded with external noise and information, your preferences will be harder to decipher. Reveal your desires by journaling through time and examining what comes up a lot
