```
---Parent 1:---
A second brain should by all rights be able to think for itself. But what is thinking in this case? The brain is a prediction engine that seems to be self referential between conscious and unconscious stimuli. In addition the brain holds concepts in many different forms, text is kind of a flatland of the data really captured in the brain. To truly create a second brain means slow evolutionary modules that can engage with each other when operational â€” each conducting its own stack. Some ideas:
	- Read a note and summarize it
	- Find similar notes based on note content
	- Chat bot with note system
	- Fetch broader data from the web about a note
	- Write programs based on the note that do something to solve the problem in the note (for open ended tasks and todos that always include switching inertia)
	- **Read a few notes at a time â€” write a new random note (tagged as machine) and is a child thought**

# Unreal Engine 5 and Motionless in White Album



Essay:

Unreal Engine 5 is a powerful game engine developed by Epic Games. While it has been used in a number of high-profile games, including the Gears of War and Unreal Tournament franchises, its potential for creating stunning visual experiences has only begun to be explored. Motionless in White's new album, Graveyard Shift, provides a perfect example of this potential. The album's artwork was created using Unreal Engine 5, and the result is an incredibly atmospheric and eerie experience that feels like you're walking through a real graveyard at night.

The use of UE5 allows for some truly impressive lighting effects, which are essential to setting the mood on Graveyard Shift. Everywhere you look there are sources of light - from the Moon to lanterns hanging from gravestones - and each one casts a different kind of shadow. This gives the environment a sense of depth and realism that would be impossible to achieve with traditional 2D art methods.

In addition to the wonderful lighting, UE5 also allows for realistic textures and materials. Every tombstone and leaf looks amazingly lifelike, making it easy to get lost in the world of the album artwork. It's clear that a lot of care and attention went into making sure every detail was as perfect as possible, and it really pays...
