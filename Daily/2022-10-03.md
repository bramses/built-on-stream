## Why aren't smart people happier?

[Source](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/why-arent-smart-people-happier)

If psychologists ever had to march into battle, a good candidate for our crests may be the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, the two lines that look like they’re different lengths but aren't:

GAZE UPON OUR WORKS AND DESPAIR

If you booted up a super-smart AI in ancient Greece, fed it all human knowledge, and asked it how to land on the moon, it would respond “You can’t land on the moon. The moon is a god floating in the sky.” How would you get it to realize the moon is actually a big rock?

My grandma does not know how to use the “input” button on her TV’s remote control, but she does know how to raise a family full of good people who love each other, how to carry on through a tragedy, and how to make the perfect pumpkin pie. We sometimes condescendingly refer to this kind of wisdom as “folksy” or “homespun,” as if answering multiple-choice questions is real intelligence, and living a good, full life is just some down-home, gee-whiz, cutesy thing that little old ladies do.

## Why read Dostoevsky? A programmer's perspective

[Source](https://fhur.me/posts/why-read-dostoevsky)

The real world is much, much more complex than what our mathematical models can express. Confusing the models for reality, or Platonism as he sometimes calls it, has caused many great failures in the world. From Communist Russia's collapse due to Marxism to the 2008 financial crisis.

That was until I started paying attention to the classics. Many people I had a lot of respect for, many of my "heroes" insisted in the idea that it was not just useful, but very important to read the classics. Important? But why? Aren't they just very well written "entertainment"? Wouldn't my time be better spent studying or practicing a useful skill other than, say, reading the monologues of a Hamlet? What use could that have in the real world, other than **entertainment**?

Unlike scientific knowledge, Dostoevsky doesn't propose a model with a degree of accuracy and best practices on how to apply the model. Instead, he narrates an archetypal story sprinkled with truths

## The Raw Truth About Lox

You can’t get lox without a note from your mother.”

Mark Federman of Russ & Daughters likes to refer to lox as “Jewish sushi.”)

## The Dream Machine

**Author: M. Mitchell Waldrop**

- ARPA would make a series of massive long-distance calls and just never hang up. ([Location 6870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=6870))
- in effect, those pulses from the spinning dial were asking the telephone system to create a complete circuit between your telephone and the one you were calling. ([Location 6895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=6895))
- (**Telegraph** lines were so noisy that transmission was limited to short hops; the clerks in each telegraph office had to write down messages as they arrived, then key them in again to send them farther down the line.) ([Location 6908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=6908))
- So in sum, said Roberts, that was the plan: full-time access, messages divided into packets, and distributed control. Now, who wanted to help? ([Location 6915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GBCX7YC&location=6915))
- Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, were happy to tell him why. Their computers were straining to keep up with local time-sharing demands as it was, the two AI researchers pointed out at length, supported by many others. And now Larry Roberts wanted the machines to handle packets, too? How were they supposed to get any work done?

## Systemantics

**Author: John Gall and D.H. Gall**

- ANY LARGE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE OPERATING MOST OF THE TIME IN FAILURE MODE ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1450))

- WHEN A FAIL-SAFE SYSTEM FAILS, IT FAILS BY FAILING TO FAIL SAFE ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1512))

- Studying Bugs for their own sake has all the charm of studying how the paint cracks on an Old Master or how many ways a typewriter key can stick. We don’t want to know all that. We just want our Systems to work as smoothly in real life as they did in our fantasies, when we were planning to buy or build them. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1553))

- Only the most banal types of Bugs are related to component reliability. A failure rate of one in a million is regularly achieved by computers whose parent companies have a failure rate of one in three, leaving the purchaser with a complete system that lacks a maintenance function. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1557))

- A special type of Bug is represented by the toaster that sometimes burns the toast or the air-conditioner that sometimes fails to cool, usually on the second day of a ten-day heat wave. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1563))

- CHERISH YOUR BUGS. STUDY THEM ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1595))

- real novelty in the world increases as complexity increases. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1647))

- AS SYSTEMS EXPAND, NEW FUNCTIONS APPEAR SUDDENLY, IN STEPWISE FASHION And, we may add, the new function typically bears no more resemblance to the old than a soufflé resembles the humble egg from which it is derived. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1650))

- AS SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THEY TEND TO LOSE BASIC FUNCTIONS ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1663))

- •Shortly after World War II, the British, in order to relieve a shortage of cooking oil, embarked on a gigantic plan to grow groundnuts (peanuts) in East Africa. The plan came to grief after eight years of fighting hostile soil and adverse climatic conditions. Eighty million dollars were lost. The project was abandoned when someone finally remembered that it was West Africa, not East Africa, where peanuts thrive.[lxvii] ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1702))

- However, the salient feature of most mad and eccentric behavior is not its defectiveness but rather its incredible ingenuity, such that merely rational persons—doctors, for example—can’t deal with it. ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1758))

- Dipping a watch in honey may slow it down so it keeps better time, but a more elegant method is to adjust the escapement.[f.] ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1762))

- a century of advances in electronics has failed to produce any improvement in the quality of the content of the messages broadcast over the air waves. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK1BIDM&location=1764))

- For uncounted centuries, Egyptian Kings and dignitaries were buried beneath simple rectangular brick structures, called mastabas (“tables”), which slowly and gradually became larger and more elaborate. Then, at a certain moment in Egyptian history, the mastaba tombs suddenly underwent a massive development into the monstrous Pyramids of the Pharaohs. What triggered that sudden plunge into grandiosity? Professor Mendelssohn has suggested[lxxv] that the tomb-building System had reached a certain level of involvement of the entire social order such that it became impossible to stop the process without disrupting the State.
