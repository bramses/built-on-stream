## whats the deal with face reveals?

### Outline

1. the internet loves face reveals
2. dream and the current era of showing who you are
	1. intentional or accidental
3. safety, pseudonymity, vulnerability amongst strangers, being recognized in public

### Supporting Evidence/Insights

- [Anime Face Reveal!🤩 Reaction Mashup - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHZvPryrJqc&ab_channel=Titan%27sReact)
- When used bilaterally, these effectively pull the corners of the mouth sideways but cannot lift them upward, as is the case with a true smile (see figure 73). ==**Interestingly, babies several weeks old will already reserve the full zygomatic smile** ==for their mothers and utilize the risorius smile for all others. If you are unhappy, it is unlikely that you will be able to smile fully using both the zygomaticus majoris and the orbicularis oculi muscles. Real smiles are difficult to fake when we have a sincere lack of emotion. ([Location 2806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0010SKSTO&location=2806))
- “O.S.B. was focussed on what we referred to as ‘physical-access operations,’ ” a senior developer from the unit, Jeremy Weber—a pseudonym—explained. This is not dragnet mass surveillance of the kind more often associated with the National Security Agency.

- curiosity
- what is the value of a face
	- vulnerability
		- everybody has a face
	- **connection**
- pseudonymity - leda
- you are only famous if the people in the room know you -- **ie fame is a function of everyone else but your perception of self**

### Open Questions/Future Research
- vtubers
- choosing to not show face on the internet forever
- taking pictures in public in a world of AR

## the tyrannical psychology of wow tier lists

### Outline

 wow tier list content reveals an interesting balance of objective data, subjective individual belief, and a superego of a society that communicates mainly through trade chat
- this reveals an interesting paradigm of how mmos are balanced, how people react to unfair realities, and **how stories promulgate into myth**

### Supporting Evidence/Insight
- **perception** baked into an unbalanced and extremely complex system of buffs debuffs luck and blizzards attempt to balance mechanics while making players feel like heroes
- the pilot behind the character is operating one of many of the same but may have different reaction times, **affinity to the class and role**, etc
- this hold is almost impossible to ignore fully unless you're willing to operate in bliss -- bliss of simming, warcraft logs, wowhead, etc
- **data can tell any story that fits your (group) narrative**
	- "im better dps, so i get better gear first priority, so i make better dps etc"
- pvp is zero sum, pve is not (playing against the house)

### Open Questions/Future Research

- if wow were perfectly balanced, what would class participation look like
- **what level of perception is most important?** 
	- guild? 
	- server? 
	- party that just wiped the 12th time?
- **do you trust your data? is it giving the full picture?**

## what exactly is non linear

### Outline
 - non linear gets thrown around a lot but its hard to see the day to day effects
- when people assume linear its because we simplify concepts into linear (and expectable) things (like M->Tues->Wed->etc)
- non linear is stressful but real - adopting systems help keep the benefit of non linearity w/o losing sleep

### Supporting Evidence/Insights

> could start with, say, a simple linear chain of symbols—(a b c d)—and then replace the third element with a whole new list: **(a b (gh) d)**. Indeed, the computer could keep on nesting one list inside another like this until it had built up matrices, tables, trees, forms, or any other kind of data structures.

> The breaks are determined via statistical tests, but they are presumed to represent general-purpose technologies (GPTs). **The 1930s were a turning point in electrification, especially of factories; 1830 was the beginning of railroads and the Second Industrial Revolution.** 1650 seems less clear; it might be due to rising labor input that is not accounted for in the calculations, or to the rise of cottage industry.

> Given that the brain is just a bunch of big matrix vector products, linear algebra deserves more appreciation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1527430909548367872))

>As a human resources executive told me, “I don’t expect people to say it’s their dream to work here forever. I roll my eyes at that. No one knows where they will be in five years. Still, the burden is on the applicants to show that working here makes sense beyond the person just wanting a job or the building being two blocks from their apartment.” **Life does not need to be linear but it does, as this executive said, need to make sense.** ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SCSCAU&location=1035))


> You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank. ([Location 2792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=2792))

linear is extracted from non linear
- works on a space series (dimensions) or a time series
	- a general purpose technology opens up options for creativity kind of like a diverging path
	- a time series non linear is a stepwise function and/or compounding

### Open Questions/Future Research

- does it matter what shape something has? even if we appreciate that the world is non linear, we cant change it?
- networks are non linear, and lack a single start and end. why is that?
- does similarity and density matter to linear examples? noon looks pretty similar every day.
- what does a culture need to have more non linear creations change how we think, and break us out of loops?
