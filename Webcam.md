Wanna use a real camera like the one in this blog post:
[Laurence Tratt: Using a "Proper" Camera as a Webcam](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/using_a_proper_camera_as_a_webcam.html)


> **==The older [A6000](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit) is readily and cheaply available==; the [A6400](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6400) seems to be slightly better as a webcam; though the [A6600](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6600)'s extra features are probably only useful for general photography.** I've heard more than once that the A6*000 family come with mediocre kit lenses (see later for an explanation) but that lenses like the [Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/camera-lenses/sel35f18) work well for webcams.
